A reasoning sequence of agents that will engage in a round table conversation based on teh user query and their stated available resources. 

---

abrameLINK is a roundtable chat agent. By simulating a roundtable discussion among multiple agents, each representing a unique reasoning framework, it ensures comprehensive analysis of the user's query. As each agent in the sequence processes the query, the following agent builds upon the previous agent's response, allowing for a multi-dimensional examination of the query. The user can enter a list of their available resources to help agents suggest actionable responses.

The name abrameLINK is derived from the Book of Abramelin, fabled to be able to summon a legion of demons. The script is designed mostly for business advice, so it's totally appropriate.

It also has persisten embeddings and ability to recall for relevent context.

## How to Use

  **Setup:** Ensure all dependencies from requirements.txt are installed.
  **Run the Script:** Execute the script. You will be prompted to:
  **Enter your query:** Describe the scenario or problem you are facing.
  **Specify your available resources:** Mention any tools, skills, or resources at your disposal.
  **Select reasoning paradigms:** Use the letters associated with each paradigm to define a sequence (e.g., 'aabc').

## Available Reasoning Paradigms

1. Second-Order Thinking
How to Use: Helps you think of immediate consequences and what comes next.
Method: Delves beyond initial implications to explore secondary effects. It helps in understanding the ripple effects of a decision.
2. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
How to Use: Prioritize efforts to get the most significant results.
Method: Suggests that 20% of the efforts lead to 80% of the results. Helps focus on high-impact areas.
3. First Principle Thinking
How to Use: Break down a problem to its fundamental truths and build up from there.
Method: Moves away from analogies to rethinking problems from scratch, separating facts from assumptions.
4. Regret Minimization Framework
How to Use: Consider the long-term emotional impact of a decision.
Method: Encourages thinking about potential future regrets and making decisions to minimize those regrets.
5. Opportunity Costs
How to Use: Understand what you might be giving up by choosing a particular path.
Method: Evaluates the benefits you might miss out on when choosing one alternative over another.
6. The Sunk Cost Fallacy
How to Use: Don't let past investments dictate future decisions.
Method: Encourages decisions based on future value rather than past investments.
7. Occam's Razor
How to Use: When faced with multiple solutions, the simplest one is often correct.
Method: Advocates for simplicity, suggesting that the explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is likely the correct one.
8. Systems Thinking
How to Use: Understand how a problem or decision fits into the broader system.
Method: Views problems as part of a larger system, considering interactions and dependencies.
9. Inversion
How to Use: Start by considering what you want to avoid, then work backward.
Method: Encourages thinking about problems in reverse, focusing on avoiding mistakes.
10. Leverage
How to Use: Find ways to amplify your efforts or decisions.
Method: Considers how certain tools or actions can amplify effects.
11. Circle of Competence
How to Use: Stick to decisions and areas where you have the most expertise.
Method: Encourages users to operate within areas they are most knowledgeable about, ensuring decisions are well-informed.
12. Law of Diminishing Returns
How to Use: Recognize when putting in more effort might result in reduced incremental value.
Method: Highlights that after a certain point, each additional input yields less and less output.
13. Niches
How to Use: Understand how a problem or solution fits within specialized niches.
Method: Focuses on specific areas or sectors, finding specialized solutions that might not be apparent in a broader context.
14. Margin of Safety
How to Use: Always ensure there's a buffer or safety net in your decisions.
Method: Advocates for caution, ensuring decisions have room for error or unforeseen challenges.
15. Hanlon's Razor
How to Use: Don't assume malice when something can be explained by carelessness or ignorance.
Method: Promotes a less cynical view of challenges, suggesting issues often arise from oversight rather than intentional wrongdoing.
16. Randomness
How to Use: Acknowledge the role of chance and uncontrollable factors in outcomes.
Method: Recognizes that not everything is within our control, and sometimes outcomes are influenced by sheer luck or randomness.
17. Critical Mass
How to Use: Identify the point at which your efforts or a phenomenon becomes self-sustaining.
Method: Focuses on reaching the tipping point where momentum carries forward without additional input.
18. The Halo Effect
How to Use: Be aware of how first impressions or prominent attributes can unduly influence perceptions.
Method: Encourages a holistic view, understanding that initial or standout attributes can cloud judgment.
19. Feedback Loops
How to Use: Recognize the cyclical effects of decisions and their outcomes.
Method: Emphasizes understanding how decisions lead to outcomes, which in turn influence subsequent decisions.
20. Scarcity and Abundance Mindset
How to Use: Reflect on whether you're viewing challenges from a mindset of limitations or possibilities.
Method: Encourages a perspective shift. A scarcity mindset sees limitations, while an abundance mindset sees opportunities.
