# abrameLINK

A sequence of reasoning agents that will engage in a round table conversation based on teh user query and their stated available resources

---

abrameLINK is a roundtable chat agent. By simulating a roundtable discussion among multiple agents, each representing a unique reasoning framework, it ensures comprehensive analysis of the user's query. As each agent in the sequence processes the query, the following agent builds upon the previous agent's response, allowing for a multi-dimensional examination of the query. The user can enter a list of their available resources to help agents suggest actionable responses.

The name abrameLINK is derived from the Book of Abramelin, fabled to be able to summon a legion of demons. The script is well designed for business advice, so it's totally appropriate. 😈 It also has persistent embeddings and ability to recall for relevent input context.

## How to Use

  **Setup:** Ensure all dependencies from requirements.txt are installed.
  
  **Run the Script:** Execute the script. You will be prompted to:
  
  **Enter your query:** Describe the scenario or problem you are facing.
  
  **Specify your available resources:** Mention any tools, skills, or resources at your disposal.
  
  **Select reasoning paradigms:** Use the letters associated with each paradigm to define a sequence (e.g., 'aabc').
